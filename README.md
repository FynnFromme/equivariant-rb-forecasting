## Requirements

To install the requirements, run:

```setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


## 3D Rayleigh-BÃ©nard Simulation
For details on how to simulate 3D Rayleigh-BÃ©nard see the help page of the corresponding script:
```
julia --project=simulation simulation/3d/RayleighBenard3D.jl --help
```

## Data Preparation
For details on how to create standardized train, validation and test datasets of 3D Rayleigh-BÃ©nard simulations, see the help page of the corresponding script:
```
python data/data_preparation.py --help
```

## Training

To train a steerable **autoencoder** for 100 epochs with the name "ae1", run the following command:

```train
python experiments/train_autoencoder.py SteerableConv ae1 100
```

To train a steerable **forecaster** using the previously trained D4cnn autoencoder for 100 epochs, run this command:

```train
python experiments/train_forecaster.py SteerableConv fc1 D4cnn ae1 100
```

For more details on all possible arguments see: 
```
python experiments/train_autoencoder.py --help
python experiments/train_forecaster.py --help
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate an **autoencoder**, run the following command with a selection of the given options:

```eval
python experiments/evaluate.py AE/D4cnn ae1 -eval_performance
```

To evaluate an **forecaster**, run the following command with a selection of the given options:

```eval
python experiments/evaluate.py FC/D4cnn fc1 -eval_autoregressive_performance
```

For more details on all possible arguments see: 
```
python experiments/evaluate.py --help
```
